```
##Start the programm
To start first lounch blender and then lounch python script, after wich you move cursor over to blender and press enter to start programm, after wich you just watch and relax
>also hold q to stop the programm<br>

#How it works?
Simple version:<br>
I got py script that reads json wich has all the inputs needed to make the art :DD
Medium version:<br>
The script loads the json and gets the array and loops trough it, at the start of each array element there is number that has coresponding action and then afterwards there are parameters. <br>
As well i had issue with that blender didn't want to take write and/or capital or shift charecters so i had to use bit hacky way to do it with making them press indiviualy XD
Hard version:<br>
jsut check the python script XD<br>
